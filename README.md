# RPG Library
RPG Library is a PHP-based web application that can be run on Apache/XAMPP. The program allows for the creation and management of RPG Characters, with features for tracking a characters personality traits, archetype, description, and profile image.

## Installation
With Apache running, open PHPMyAdmin and import the provided database-init file. This will populate the database with the tables it needs to function. From there, simply open the program in a web browser. There is an admin account with examples of different characters, it can be access by using the following login:

Username: Admin

Password: p@ssword1

## User Management
Users can register through the application itself, and are managed on an administrative level from the SQL database. Each user has their own library and characters.

## Character Management
Characters can be added from the main library screen after logging in. Editing/Deleting characters is handled by clicking on their tile and then clicking the corresponding button in the character details page. Almost all fields are optional to provide users with freeform control of their own characters. The only required field is the character's *First Name*.

## Upcoming Features
* Passwords are being migrated to a hash-based system, rather than plaintext; this will give increased security for the application.
* Character stats are being added, allowing a user to specify custom stats for a character and set values for them.
